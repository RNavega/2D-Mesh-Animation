## Blender Exporter Add-on

**io_scene_lua.py** is a plugin exporter for Blender 2.79 and up (including the 3.x series).  

To be installed as a third-party add-on ([similar to this](https://blender.stackexchange.com/a/1689)), it allows you to export your static and animated models to a Lua script file. The sample model `asset.lua` used in this demo was exported like this.  

In this folder you can find two scenes, one for Blender 2.79 and another for Blender 3+.
